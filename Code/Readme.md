# Water Level and Water Consumption Monitor

**Firmware Version:** 0.6.9

An ESP32-based IoT system designed for real-time monitoring of water tank level and water consumption. The device uses differential pressure sensors to estimate water level and a flow sensor to measure water usage. Data can be monitored locally through an LCD display or remotely through the Blynk platform.

## Features

* Real-time water level measurement using differential pressure sensors.
* Water consumption monitoring using a pulse-based flow sensor.
* Local visualization through a 20x4 I2C LCD.
* Remote monitoring using Blynk IoT.
* Automatic daily reset of consumption statistics.
* Offline operation when internet connectivity is unavailable.
* Dual-core processing using the ESP32 FreeRTOS architecture.
* Non-volatile memory storage for calibration offsets.
* Remote configuration of system parameters through the Blynk application.

## System Operation

### Water Level Measurement

The system continuously samples both pressure sensors and calculates the water column height using a differential measurement:

Level = k × (Vwater − Vair − Offset) / Vs

where:

* Vwater = water pressure sensor voltage
* Vair = atmospheric pressure sensor voltage
* Offset = stored zero reference
* Vs = sensor supply voltage
* k = calibration constant

The resulting level is displayed in meters and converted into a percentage of total tank capacity.

### Water Consumption Measurement

A pulse-based flow sensor is used to determine:

* Instantaneous flow rate (L/min)
* Total accumulated consumption (L)

Flow calculations are updated every second.

### Zero-Level Calibration

Pressing the calibration button stores the current differential pressure value as a reference offset. The offset is saved in the ESP32 non-volatile memory and remains available after power cycles.

### Daily Consumption Reset

Using the Blynk RTC service, the system automatically resets daily water consumption counters at midnight.

## Software Architecture

The firmware uses both ESP32 cores:

### Core 0

Handles:

* Blynk communication
* Wi-Fi management
* Timer execution
* Cloud synchronization

### Core 1

Handles:

* Sensor acquisition
* Signal processing
* Flow calculations
* LCD updates

This architecture allows measurement tasks to continue operating even when network communication is interrupted.
